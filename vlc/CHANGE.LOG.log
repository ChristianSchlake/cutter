CHANGELOG

    * Format: the control panel has been split into two javascript 
      libraries, a CSS file, and an HTML file containing an example
      of the required HTML to be inserted into the webpage.


    * Functions: VWCP contains the minimum number of fucntions
      to support basic webplayer features: play/pause, stop
      and fullscreen.  It also supports seek by dragging the slider
      in the seek bar or clicking on the bar.  

      Be aware that the slide seek functions have a known bug that 
      if the mouse moves off the slider and displays a black circle 
      with a line through it, the seek function will not turn off 
      and the slider will jiggle when the mouse moves over it until 
      you click on the seekbar again.


    * Display: This version of VWCP can be embedded anywhere
      in the webpage.  It will autodetect its position on page
      load to correct for any differences in the default position
      (0,0) and the actual position.

      The default display size in the page is 720x540.  You may resize
      VWCP to your desired dimensions by altering the display 
      variables in the vwcpconfig.js file.


    * Playlist: All playlist functions have been disabled 
      in this version of VWCP.  It has been modified to 
      support single-video media player functions with the minimum
      filesize and number of files.


    * Styling: VWCP has been re-written with CSS styling in order
      to better support browser-based zooming.
